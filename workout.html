  <h3>Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)</h3>

  <!-- Exercise 1 -->
  <details class="exercise-box">
    <summary><b>Incline Dumbbell Press</b></summary>
     <div class="exercise-content">
     <p> The incline dumbbell press is a powerful exercise for building the upper chest and shoulders. Set your bench at a 30–45° angle, sit down with dumbbells on your quads, and kick them into position as you lie back. Keep your chest up, shoulder blades pulled down, feet planted firmly, and core braced as if preparing for a punch. Press the dumbbells upward to full lockout, then lower them under control, letting your shoulder blades move naturally while staying stable. Done with proper form, this lift adds both size and strength to your upper body</p>

<details class="exercise-box">
  <summary><b>Flat Dumbbell Fly</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>The flat dumbbell fly is a chest isolation exercise that emphasizes stretch and contraction. Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended above your chest with a slight bend in the elbows. Slowly open your arms in a wide arc until you feel a deep stretch across your chest, then squeeze the weights back together under control. Keep the movement smooth, avoid locking your elbows, and focus on engaging the chest rather than the shoulders for maximum benefit.</p>

  <!-- Exercise 3 -->
<details class="exercise-box">
  <summary><b>Weighted Dips</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>Weighted dips are a powerful compound movement for building the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Using parallel bars, lean slightly forward to emphasize the chest or stay more upright to target the triceps. Lower your body until your arms are about parallel to the ground, then press back up with control. Keep your core tight, chest lifted, and shoulders stable throughout to avoid unnecessary strain while maximizing strength and muscle growth.</p>

<!-- Exercise 4 -->
<details class="exercise-box">
  <summary><b>Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>The seated dumbbell shoulder press is one of the best exercises for building strong, defined shoulders while also engaging the triceps. Sit upright with your back supported, dumbbells at shoulder level, and core braced. Press the weights overhead in a controlled motion, keeping your ribcage down and avoiding excessive arch in your lower back. Lower the dumbbells slowly back to starting position and repeat for a powerful upper body builder.</p>

<details class="exercise-box">
  <summary><b>Dumbbell Lateral Raises</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>The dumbbell lateral raise is a staple for isolating and building the side delts, giving your shoulders a wider and more defined look. Stand tall with dumbbells at your sides, keep a slight bend in the elbows, and raise your arms to shoulder height in a controlled motion. Focus on leading with your elbows rather than your hands, avoid swinging through the torso, and control both the lift and the lowering phase. This simple yet effective movement creates well-rounded shoulder development when performed consistently with good form.</p>

<!-- Exercise 6 -->
<details class="exercise-box">
  <summary><b>Overhead Triceps Extension</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>The overhead triceps extension targets the long head of the triceps, helping build stronger and fuller arms. Hold a dumbbell securely overhead, lower it slowly behind your head for a full stretch, then extend your arms back to lockout with control. Keep your elbows close to your head, avoid flaring, and focus on squeezing the triceps through each rep. Done correctly, this isolation move delivers both strength and definition to the upper arms.</p>

  <summary><b>V-Crunches</b></summary>
  <div class="exercise-content">
    <p>V-crunches are a powerful core finisher that target the entire abdominal wall. Start lying flat with arms and legs extended, then contract your abs to lift both into a “V” shape, reaching your hands toward your toes. Lower slowly under control, keeping tension on the core throughout. Avoid pulling on the neck or swinging the legs—focus on leading with the chest and compressing the abs for maximum benefit.</p>

    <!-- Diet Basics -->
    <article id="diet-basics" class="card">
      <h3>Diet for Skinny People (Gaining Weight the Right Way)</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re naturally skinny, gaining muscle is about eating <b>more than 
        you burn</b> while keeping the food quality high. Here are simple rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Eat in a Calorie Surplus</b> – Track your meals. Add an extra 400–500 calories daily.</li>
        <li><b>Protein is King</b> – Paneer, lentils, whey protein shakes.</li>
        <li><b>Carbs for Energy</b> – Rice, roti, oats, potatoes, bananas – don’t fear carbs.</li>
        <li><b>Healthy Fats</b> – Nuts, peanut butter, ghee, avocados keep hormones strong.</li>
        <li><b>Eat Frequently</b> – 5–6 smaller meals work better than 2 huge meals.</li>
        <li><b>Train & Rest</b> – Muscles grow when you sleep, not just in the gym.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bonus tip: <i>Don’t try to bulk up with just junk food. You’ll only gain fat, 
        not muscle.</i> Stick to whole foods, train hard, and watch yourself grow stronger.
