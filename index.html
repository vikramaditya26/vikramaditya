      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello World! üëã <br><br>
        I am <strong>Vikram Aditya</strong> (also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityakumar2608/" target="_blank">Aditya Kumar</a> and ÁéãÈò≥Êòé (Wang Yangming)).  
      </p>
      <p>
        My life is guided by a single core value inspired by the Buddha‚Äôs wisdom:  
        <em>‚ÄúWhat we think, we become.‚Äù</em>
      </p>

         <p>Building upon this wisdom, I have defined five core values that guide my actions and decisions of my life:</p>
   <p>
    <strong>1. Ethics is Fundamental</strong><br>
    Integrity is non-negotiable in how we live and work. This is practiced by respecting everything equally - treating people, work, and nature with the same level of respect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Be Present</strong><br>
    This means focusing on one thing at a time and giving it full attention. This practice helps value each moment and avoid wasting time. It involves taking small tasks seriously, understanding that handling things with care leads to bigger accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Love and Respect Yourself</strong><br>
    Self-care and self-respect form the foundation for everything else. This involves avoiding complaints and instead accepting circumstances and taking action. It means staying both humble and hungry for knowledge while remaining grounded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Contribute Proactively</strong><br>
    This mindset focuses on asking what can be given rather than what can be received. It means creating value rather than just consuming, and committing to continuous learning. It requires taking bold action and pursuing simple ideas with deep focus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. Courage, Discipline, and Consistency</strong><br>
    This approach begins with the courage to start and the discipline to continue. It recognizes that small daily actions accumulate into significant results over time. The focus remains on the process rather than the outcome, understanding that action and progress matter more than perfect planning.
</p>
       
      <p>
        This website is part of my <strong>100-day challenge</strong> ‚Äî a small experiment where I aim to get <em>1% better every day</em>.  
        Here, I share my personal experiences, thoughts, and learnings.  
        If you notice some sections incomplete, that simply means I‚Äôm still building and improving.
