      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello World! 👋 <br><br>
        I am <strong>Vikram Aditya</strong> (also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityakumar2608/" target="_blank">Aditya Kumar</a> and 王阳明 (Wang Yangming)).  
      </p>
      <p>
        My life is guided by a single core value inspired by the Buddha’s wisdom:  
        <em>“What we think, we become.”</em>
      </p>

         <p>Building upon this wisdom, I have defined five core values that guide my actions and decisions of my life:</p>
   <p>
     
    <!-- Core Values -->
    <details class="core-box">
      <summary><b>1. Ethics is Fundamental</b></summary>
      <p>Integrity is non-negotiable in how we live and work. This is practiced by respecting everything equally — treating people, work, and nature with the same level of respect.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="core-box">
      <summary><b>2. Be Present</b></summary>
      <p>This means focusing on one thing at a time and giving it full attention. It helps value each moment, avoid wasting time, and turn small actions into big accomplishments.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="core-box">
      <summary><b>3. Love and Respect Yourself</b></summary>
      <p>Self-care and self-respect form the foundation for everything else. Avoid complaints, accept circumstances, and take action. Stay humble, hungry for knowledge, and grounded.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="core-box">
      <summary><b>4. Contribute Proactively</b></summary>
      <p>Focus on what can be given rather than received. Create value, commit to continuous learning, take bold action, and pursue simple ideas with deep focus.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="core-box">
      <summary><b>5. Courage, Discipline, and Consistency</b></summary>
      <p>Begin with courage to start and discipline to continue. Small daily actions accumulate into significant results. Focus on process, not perfection — progress matters most.</p>
    </details>

      This website is part of my <strong>100-day challenge</strong> — a small experiment where I aim to get <em>1% better every day</em>.  
      Here, I share my personal experiences, thoughts, and learnings.  
      If you notice some sections incomplete, that simply means I’m still building and improving.
