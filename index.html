      <h2>About Me</h2>
      
      <p>
        Hello World! 👋<br><br>
        I am <strong>Vikram Aditya</strong> (also known as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityakumar2608/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aditya Kumar</a> and 王阳明 - Wang Yangming). 
        I'm a Civil Engineering graduate from <strong>IIT Bombay</strong> (Class of 2024), currently working in the <strong>Founder's Office at Teachmint</strong> in Bengaluru.
      </p>


      <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
      <p>
        After graduating from IIT Bombay, I've been exploring the startup ecosystem through various Founder's Office roles. 
        I spent time at <strong>Urban Farm</strong> in Udaipur learning about organic farming and soil health, 
        worked at a <strong>healthcare stealth startup</strong> understanding hospital operations from ground staff to directors, 
        and now I'm at <strong>Teachmint</strong>, learning the fundamentals of how a company operates.
      </p>

      <p>
        At IIT Bombay, I wasn't just studying civil engineering - I was exploring everything from entrepreneurship to law, meditation to chess. 
        I held multiple leadership positions including <strong>Department General Secretary</strong> of the Civil Engineering Association, 
        where I led a team of 32 and managed a budget of ₹0.85M. I also explored research at <strong>Cambridge Judge Business School</strong> 
        and <strong>Tsinghua University</strong> in China, and even filed a patent for a biomedical waste bin at IIT Gandhinagar's Invention Factory.
      </p>

      <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        My life is guided by a single core value inspired by the Buddha's wisdom: 
        <em>"What we think, we become."</em>
      </p>

      <p>Building upon this wisdom, I have defined five core values that guide my actions and decisions:</p>

      <details class="core-box">
        <summary><b>1. Ethics is Fundamental</b></summary>
        <p>Integrity is non-negotiable in how we live and work. This is practiced by respecting everything equally — treating people, work, and nature with the same level of respect.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="core-box">
        <summary><b>2. Be Present</b></summary>
        <p>This means focusing on one thing at a time and giving it full attention. It helps value each moment, avoid wasting time, and turn small actions into big accomplishments.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="core-box">
        <summary><b>3. Love and Respect Yourself</b></summary>
        <p>Self-care and self-respect form the foundation for everything else. Avoid complaints, accept circumstances, and take action. Stay humble, hungry for knowledge, and grounded.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="core-box">
        <summary><b>4. Contribute Proactively</b></summary>
        <p>Focus on what can be given rather than received. Create value, commit to continuous learning, take bold action, and pursue simple ideas with deep focus.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="core-box">
        <summary><b>5. Courage, Discipline, and Consistency</b></summary>
        <p>Begin with courage to start and discipline to continue. Small daily actions accumulate into significant results. Focus on process, not perfection — progress matters most.</p>
      </details>

      <h3>Why This Website?</h3>
      <p>
        This website is part of my <strong>100-day challenge</strong> — a small experiment where I aim to get <em>1% better every day</em>. 
        Here, I share my personal experiences, thoughts, and learnings across finance, books, workouts, and life in general.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you notice some sections incomplete, that simply means I'm still building and improving. As Leonardo da Vinci said: 
        <em>"Learning never exhausts the mind. No field is foreign - just unexplored."</em>
