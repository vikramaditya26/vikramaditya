          <p>Personal finance is about managing your money wisely: how you earn, save, spend, and invest it. It's not just about getting rich — it's about building financial security and peace of mind.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The fundamental questions to ask yourself:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do I know where my money goes each month?</li>
            <li>Do I save before spending?</li>
            <li>Have I set clear financial goals?</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The Three Pillars of Personal Finance:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Track spending:</b> You can't manage what you don't measure. Use a simple notebook, spreadsheet, or app.</li>
            <li><b>Set goals:</b> Define short-term goals (emergency fund, vacation) and long-term goals (house, retirement).</li>
            <li><b>Pay yourself first:</b> Save or invest a portion of your income immediately, before spending on anything else.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 Golden Rule:</strong> Spend less than you earn, and invest the rest. It's that simple.</p>

          <h3><span class="icon">📊</span> Budgeting & The 50/30/20 Rule</h3>
          <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div class="finance-card-body">
          <p>A budget gives every rupee a purpose. The simplest framework is the <strong>50/30/20 rule</strong>:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>50% — Needs:</b> Essentials like rent, groceries, utilities, loan EMIs, insurance.</li>
            <li><b>30% — Wants:</b> Entertainment, dining out, hobbies, shopping — things you enjoy but don't need.</li>
            <li><b>20% — Savings & Investments:</b> Emergency fund, mutual funds, stocks, PPF, retirement accounts.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Building Your Emergency Fund:</strong></p>
          <p>Before investing, build an emergency fund covering 6-12 months of expenses. Keep it in a liquid savings account or liquid mutual fund — accessible but not too accessible.</p>

          <p><strong>Automate Your Savings:</strong></p>
          <p>Set up automatic transfers on payday. When saving is automatic, you don't rely on willpower. You pay yourself first before the money disappears into daily expenses.</p>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Adjust the percentages based on your situation. If you're in debt, allocate more to paying it off. If you earn well, save more than 20%.</p>

          <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div class="finance-card-body">
          <p>Not all debt is bad. A home loan or education loan can be good debt — it helps you acquire assets or skills that appreciate over time. But high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans) is dangerous and should be avoided.</p>

          <p><strong>Smart Debt Management:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Pay credit cards in full:</b> Never carry a balance. Credit card interest rates (36-48% annually) will destroy your wealth.</li>
            <li><b>Use the Avalanche Method:</b> If you have multiple debts, pay off the highest interest rate first while maintaining minimum payments on others.</li>
            <li><b>Borrow wisely:</b> Only take loans for appreciating assets (home, education) — never for depreciating items (car, vacation, gadgets).</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Understanding Your CIBIL Score:</strong></p>
          <p>Your credit score (300-900) determines your borrowing power. Above 750 is excellent. Maintain it by paying all EMIs and bills on time, keeping credit utilization below 30%, and not applying for too many loans/cards at once.</p>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 Remember:</strong> If you can't afford to pay cash for something, you probably can't afford to put it on a credit card either.</p>

          <h3><span class="icon">📈</span> The Power of Compounding</h3>
          <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div class="finance-card-body">
          <p>Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world." Here's why:</p>

          <p><strong>The Rule of 72:</strong></p>
          <p>Divide 72 by your annual return rate to find how many years it takes to double your money. At 12% returns, your money doubles in 6 years. At 8%, it takes 9 years.</p>

          <p><strong>Why Starting Early Matters:</strong></p>
          <p>If you invest ₹5,000/month starting at age 25 with 12% returns, you'll have ₹3.5 crore by 55. Start at 35? You'll have only ₹1 crore. Same monthly investment, 10 years less time — ₹2.5 crore difference!</p>

          <p><strong>The Three Rules of Compounding:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Start early:</b> Time is your greatest asset. Even small amounts grow massive over decades.</li>
            <li><b>Stay consistent:</b> Regular investing (SIP) beats timing the market every time.</li>
            <li><b>Never interrupt:</b> Don't withdraw from long-term investments for short-term needs.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 The Magic:</strong> Compounding works on your returns too. You earn interest on your interest. This is why the growth curve is exponential, not linear.</p>

          <p>From lowest to highest risk — here are your options:</p>

          <p><strong>Low Risk (Capital Preservation):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Fixed Deposits (FD):</b> 6-7% returns, guaranteed but taxable. Good for short-term goals.</li>
            <li><b>PPF (Public Provident Fund):</b> 7.1% tax-free returns, 15-year lock-in. Excellent for long-term, tax-free growth.</li>
            <li><b>Debt Mutual Funds:</b> 7-9% returns, more tax-efficient than FDs for holding > 3 years.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Medium Risk (Balanced Growth):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Hybrid/Balanced Funds:</b> Mix of equity and debt. 10-12% expected returns with moderate volatility.</li>
            <li><b>Gold (SGBs or Gold ETFs):</b> Hedge against inflation. Sovereign Gold Bonds give 2.5% annual interest plus gold price appreciation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Higher Risk (Wealth Creation):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Index Funds/ETFs:</b> Track Nifty 50 or Sensex. 12-15% historical returns. Warren Buffett's recommendation for most investors.</li>
            <li><b>Equity Mutual Funds:</b> Actively managed, aim to beat the market. Higher expense ratio but potential for better returns.</li>
            <li><b>Direct Stocks:</b> Highest potential returns but requires knowledge, time, and emotional discipline.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 Beginner's Path:</strong> Start with Index Funds via SIP. Once you understand markets better, you can explore individual stocks and other options.</p>

          <p>The stock market is where you buy ownership in companies. When you own a stock, you own a tiny piece of that company's future profits.</p>

          <p><strong>Key Terms to Know:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>NSE & BSE:</b> India's two main stock exchanges. NSE is larger and more liquid.</li>
            <li><b>Nifty 50:</b> Index of 50 largest NSE companies. Benchmark for Indian markets.</li>
            <li><b>Sensex:</b> Index of 30 largest BSE companies. Older but still widely tracked.</li>
            <li><b>Demat Account:</b> Where your stocks are held electronically. You need this + trading account to invest.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>How to Start:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open a Demat + Trading account (Zerodha, Groww, etc.)</li>
            <li>Start with Index Funds or Blue-chip stocks</li>
            <li>Use SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) to invest regularly</li>
            <li>Think in years, not days. Markets go up and down but trend upward long-term</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trading based on tips or rumors</li>
            <li>Panic selling during market crashes</li>
            <li>Trying to time the market instead of time IN the market</li>
            <li>Putting money you need soon into volatile stocks</li>

        <div class="finance-card-body">
          <p><strong>Tax Saving Under Section 80C (₹1.5 Lakh limit):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>ELSS Mutual Funds:</b> Only 3-year lock-in, potential 12-15% returns. Best tax-saving option for most.</li>
            <li><b>PPF:</b> 15-year lock-in, 7.1% tax-free returns. Safe and guaranteed.</li>
            <li><b>NPS (National Pension System):</b> Additional ₹50,000 deduction under 80CCD(1B). Good for retirement planning.</li>
            <li><b>EPF:</b> If you're salaried, this is automatic. Don't withdraw it early.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Essential Insurance:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Health Insurance:</b> Get at least ₹10 Lakh cover for family. Medical inflation is ~15% annually. Don't rely on employer insurance alone.</li>
            <li><b>Term Life Insurance:</b> If you have dependents, get a pure term plan (10-15x your annual income). Avoid ULIPs and money-back policies — they're expensive and give poor returns.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Tax Harvesting:</strong></p>
          <p>Long-term capital gains (LTCG) above ₹1 lakh on equity are taxed at 10%. You can book ₹1 lakh gains tax-free each year by selling and re-buying — this is called tax harvesting.</p>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>💡 Golden Rule:</strong> Never mix insurance with investment. Keep them separate — term insurance for protection, mutual funds/stocks for wealth creation.</p>
