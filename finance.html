      <summary>1. Understanding Money and Personal Finance</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Personal finance is about managing your money: how you earn, save, spend, and invest it. It's not just about getting rich; it's about planning your financial future so you have financial security and peace of mind.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself: Do I know where my money goes each month? Do I save before spending? Have I set clear goals (like a home, a trip, or retirement)? These questions start your journey toward financial literacy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Track spending:</b> Note down your income and expenses. Use a notebook or app.</li>
          <li><b>Set goals:</b> Define short-term goals (like a gadget or holiday) and long-term goals (house, retirement).</li>
          <li><b>Pay yourself first:</b> Save or invest a part of your income right away, before using money for other things.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Golden rule:</i> Spend less than you earn, and invest the rest.</p>
      </div>

      <summary>2. Budgeting and Saving</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Budgeting means giving each rupee a job. Think of it as a plan for how you will spend and save. A simple method is the <b>50/30/20 rule</b>: 50% of income goes to needs (rent, food, bills), 30% to wants (shopping, entertainment), and 20% to savings/investment. You can adjust these percentages based on your own situation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Needs (50%):</b> Essential expenses like rent/mortgage, groceries, loan EMIs, utilities.</li>
          <li><b>Wants (30%):</b> Lifestyle and fun: movies, dining out, hobbies, or any non-essential shopping.</li>
          <li><b>Savings (20%):</b> Money you save first (in a savings account, PPF, mutual fund, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, build an <b>emergency fund</b> of about 6-12 months of expenses in a liquid place (like a savings account or liquid fund). This fund is your safety net for job loss, medical emergencies, or sudden big expenses.</p>
        <p>If you can, automate your savings: as soon as you get paid, transfer a fixed amount to savings or investments. This way you pay yourself first before spending on other things.</p>

      <summary>3. Managing Debt and Credit</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Debt means borrowing money today and paying back later. Some debt (like a home or education loan) can be useful, but high-interest debt is dangerous. Credit cards and personal loans often charge very high interest, so avoid carrying balances on them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pay cards in full:</b> Always pay your credit card bill fully every month to avoid interest.</li>
          <li><b>Borrow wisely:</b> Don’t take loans for short-term wants. Use loans only for things that add value (house, higher education).</li>
          <li><b>Lower interest:</b> If you have high-interest debt, look for ways to refinance to a cheaper loan.</li>
          <li><b>Maintain a good credit score (CIBIL):</b> Pay all bills (EMI, credit card, utilities) on time. A good score helps you get loans easily at better rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, if debt is overwhelming, list all debts and pay them one by one, starting with the one with the highest interest. Paying off debt frees up money to save and invest.</p>

      <summary>4. Basics of Investing</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Investing means putting money into assets (like stocks or funds) so it can grow over time. The alternative is saving in a bank, which keeps money safe but grows slowly. Investing allows you to beat inflation (the rising cost of things) and grow wealth. Think of investing like planting seeds: with time they can grow into big trees (compounding).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Start early:</b> Even small amounts invested regularly add up over years.</li>
          <li><b>Compounding:</b> Reinvested returns (like interest or dividends) earn more money, accelerating growth.</li>
          <li><b>Diversify:</b> Don’t put all your money in one place. Spread investments across stocks, bonds, gold, etc., to reduce risk.</li>
          <li><b>Stay long-term:</b> Markets go up and down. Stay invested through ups and downs; avoid panic selling.</li>
          <li><b>Understand risk:</b> Higher returns usually come with higher risk. Only invest in things you understand and can hold onto during bad times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Investing ₹1000 at 8% annual return doubles to about ₹2000 in ~9 years. This shows why time in the market is key. Avoid “get-rich-quick” schemes—genuine wealth building takes time and patience.</p>

      <summary>5. Stock Market and Index Funds</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The stock market is a place to buy shares (small ownership pieces) of companies. In India, two major exchanges are NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange). Market indexes like the Nifty 50 (50 large NSE stocks) and Sensex (30 large BSE stocks) track overall market performance. Historically, markets trend upward over the long term.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stocks:</b> When you own a stock, you own a part of that company. If the company does well, the stock value may rise (and you can sell it for a profit).</li>
          <li><b>Index Funds:</b> Instead of picking individual stocks, beginners can buy index funds or ETFs that track Nifty or Sensex. These funds spread risk over many companies. (Warren Buffett says this is a smart choice for most people.)</li>
          <li><b>Stay patient:</b> The market has ups and downs. Don’t panic during a drop or get greedy in a rise. Think long-term.</li>
          <li><b>Risks:</b> Invest only money you won’t need soon. The stock market is for building wealth over years, not for quick gains.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Mutual Funds and SIP</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>A mutual fund is a pool of many investors' money, managed by professionals. Funds invest in stocks, bonds, or both, so you get diversification easily. They’re useful for small investors who want exposure to markets without picking stocks themselves.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Equity funds:</b> Invest mainly in stocks. Higher growth potential (in the long term), but more ups and downs.</li>
          <li><b>Debt funds:</b> Invest in bonds/loans. Less risky, lower returns. Useful for short-term goals or parking money.</li>
          <li><b>Hybrid funds:</b> Mix of equity and debt for balanced risk.</li>
          <li><b>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan):</b> Invest a fixed amount in a mutual fund every month. This builds discipline and uses rupee-cost averaging (buy more units when prices are low).</li>
          <li><b>Tax-saving funds:</b> Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) are equity funds with a 3-year lock-in. They help you save tax under Section 80C (₹1.5 lakh limit).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: Choose funds with good track records and low fees. Investing via SIP in a well-known fund is often safer than trying to time the market.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>7. Insurance (Protection)</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Insurance protects you and your family from big financial losses. It is not an investment. Important types in India include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Health Insurance:</b> Covers hospital and medical expenses. A must-have. Check the coverage (sum insured) and network hospitals.</li>
          <li><b>Term Life Insurance:</b> Provides money to your family if you pass away. Buy a term plan (pure life cover) of about 10-15 times your annual income. It's cheaper than whole-life or endowment plans.</li>
          <li><b>Vehicle Insurance:</b> Covers accidents for your car or bike. Mandatory by law. Always renew on time.</li>
          <li><b>Other covers:</b> You may consider personal accident cover, home insurance, or critical illness cover based on your needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: Insurance is for protection, not investment. Compare policies and read terms carefully. Avoid plans that mix saving/investment with insurance (like ULIPs) unless you fully understand them.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. Retirement and Long-Term Goals</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>It’s never too early to plan for retirement or big life goals. Decide what you want (children’s education, home, retirement) and estimate how much money you will need.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Employee Provident Fund (EPF):</b> If you are salaried, a portion of your salary goes into EPF (with employer’s contribution) each month, saving for retirement.</li>
          <li><b>Public Provident Fund (PPF):</b> A government-backed 15-year saving scheme. It offers around 7-8% interest (tax-free). Good for long-term goals.</li>
          <li><b>National Pension System (NPS):</b> A government retirement scheme where you invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. It provides tax benefits.</li>
          <li><b>Market investments:</b> Keep investing in mutual funds or stocks with a long-term view. Even small monthly SIPs grow significantly over decades because of compounding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example goal: Suppose you want ₹1 crore at retirement. Use retirement calculators or simple math to find out how much to invest monthly. Stay consistent; compounding will help grow your savings over time.</p>

      <summary>9. Protecting Against Scams</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Be careful of offers that sound too good to be true. Scams often promise guaranteed high returns with low risk. Remember, there is no easy shortcut to wealth. Protect yourself by following these rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Verify before investing:</b> Invest only through authorized channels (SEBI-registered brokers, AMFI-registered mutual funds, IRDAI-licensed insurers).</li>
          <li><b>Avoid Ponzi/Pyramid schemes:</b> Do not join schemes where returns come from recruiting others (like famous scams).</li>
          <li><b>No sharing confidential info:</b> Never give your bank OTP, passwords, or PINs to anyone. Scammers often steal money this way.</li>
          <li><b>Be skeptical:</b> If someone guarantees huge returns (like doubling money), it's likely a fraud. Research and double-check before you invest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When in doubt, pause and research. You can ask a trusted financial advisor or knowledgeable friend. Staying alert protects your money.</p>
