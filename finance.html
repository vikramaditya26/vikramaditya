      <summary>1. Understanding Money and Personal Finance</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Personal finance is about managing your money: how you earn, save, spend, and invest it. It's not just about getting rich; it's about planning your financial future so you have financial security and peace of mind.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself: Do I know where my money goes each month? Do I save before spending? Have I set clear goals (like a home, a trip, or retirement)? These questions start your journey toward financial literacy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Track spending:</b> Note down your income and expenses. Use a notebook or app.</li>
          <li><b>Set goals:</b> Define short-term goals (like a gadget or holiday) and long-term goals (house, retirement).</li>
          <li><b>Pay yourself first:</b> Save or invest a part of your income right away, before using money for other things.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Golden rule:</i> Spend less than you earn, and invest the rest.</p>

      <summary>2. Budgeting and Saving</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Budgeting means giving each rupee a job. Think of it as a plan for how you will spend and save. A simple method is the <b>50/30/20 rule</b>: 50% of income goes to needs (rent, food, bills), 30% to wants (shopping, entertainment), and 20% to savings/investment. You can adjust these percentages based on your own situation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Needs (50%):</b> Essential expenses like rent/mortgage, groceries, loan EMIs, utilities.</li>
          <li><b>Wants (30%):</b> Lifestyle and fun: movies, dining out, hobbies, or any non-essential shopping.</li>
          <li><b>Savings (20%):</b> Money you save first (in a savings account, PPF, mutual fund, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, build an <b>emergency fund</b> of about 6-12 months of expenses in a liquid place (like a savings account or liquid fund). This fund is your safety net for job loss, medical emergencies, or sudden big expenses.</p>
        <p>If you can, automate your savings: as soon as you get paid, transfer a fixed amount to savings or investments. This way you pay yourself first before spending on other things.</p>

      <summary>3. Managing Debt and Credit</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Debt means borrowing money today and paying back later. Some debt (like a home or education loan) can be useful, but high-interest debt is dangerous. Credit cards and personal loans often charge very high interest, so avoid carrying balances on them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pay cards in full:</b> Always pay your credit card bill fully every month to avoid interest.</li>
          <li><b>Borrow wisely:</b> Don’t take loans for short-term wants. Use loans only for things that add value (house, higher education).</li>
          <li><b>Lower interest:</b> If you have high-interest debt, look for ways to refinance to a cheaper loan.</li>
          <li><b>Maintain a good credit score (CIBIL):</b> Pay all bills (EMI, credit card, utilities) on time. A good score helps you get loans easily at better rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, if debt is overwhelming, list all debts and pay them one by one, starting with the one with the highest interest. Paying off debt frees up money to save and invest.</p>

      <summary>4. Basics of Investing</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Investing means putting money into assets (like stocks or funds) so it can grow over time. The alternative is saving in a bank, which keeps money safe but grows slowly. Investing allows you to beat inflation (the rising cost of things) and grow wealth. Think of investing like planting seeds: with time they can grow into big trees (compounding).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Start early:</b> Even small amounts invested regularly add up over years.</li>
          <li><b>Compounding:</b> Reinvested returns (like interest or dividends) earn more money, accelerating growth.</li>
          <li><b>Diversify:</b> Don’t put all your money in one place. Spread investments across stocks, bonds, gold, etc., to reduce risk.</li>
          <li><b>Stay long-term:</b> Markets go up and down. Stay invested through ups and downs; avoid panic selling.</li>
          <li><b>Understand risk:</b> Higher returns usually come with higher risk. Only invest in things you understand and can hold onto during bad times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Investing ₹1000 at 8% annual return doubles to about ₹2000 in ~9 years. This shows why time in the market is key. Avoid “get-rich-quick” schemes—genuine wealth building takes time and patience.</p>

      <summary>5. Stock Market and Index Funds</summary>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The stock market is a place to buy shares (small ownership pieces) of companies. In India, two major exchanges are NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange). Market indexes like the Nifty 50 (50 large NSE stocks) and Sensex (30 large BSE stocks) track overall market performance. Historically, markets trend upward over the long term.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stocks:</b> When you own a stock, you own a part of that company. If the company does well, the stock value may rise (and you can sell it for a profit).</li>
          <li><b>Index Funds:</b> Instead of picking individual stocks, beginners can buy index funds or ETFs that track Nifty or Sensex. These funds spread risk over many companies. (Warren Buffett says this is a smart choice for most people.)</li>
          <li><b>Stay patient:</b> The market has ups and downs. Don’t panic during a drop or get greedy in a rise. Think long-term.</li>
          <li><b>Risks:</b> Invest only money you won’t need soon. The stock market is for building wealth over years, not for quick gains.</li>
        </ul>
