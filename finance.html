    <!-- Section 1: Basics -->
    <article class="card">
      <h3>1. Understanding Personal Finance</h3>
      <p>
        Personal finance is simply the way you manage your money — earning, saving, investing, protecting, and spending wisely. 
        It’s not just about getting rich; it’s about making sure you have <b>financial security</b>, freedom of choice, and peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step is awareness. Ask yourself: Do you know where your money goes each month? Do you save before you spend? 
        Do you have an emergency fund? These small questions form the base of financial literacy. 
      </p>
      <p><i>Golden rule: Spend less than you earn, and invest the difference.</i></p>

      <h3>2. Saving & Budgeting</h3>
      <p>
        Budgeting doesn’t mean restrictions; it means <b>control</b>. A simple method is the <b>50/30/20 rule</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>50%</b> of income for needs (rent, food, bills)</li>
        <li><b>30%</b> for wants (travel, shopping, hobbies)</li>
        <li><b>20%</b> for savings and investments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Build an <b>emergency fund</b> — at least 6 months of expenses in a safe place (like a savings account or liquid mutual fund). 
        This protects you from job loss, medical emergencies, or unexpected expenses.
      </p>

    <article class="card">
      <h3>3. Basics of Investing</h3>
      <p>
        Saving keeps money safe. Investing makes money grow. If you only save, inflation will eat your wealth over time. 
        That’s why investing is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key principles:
        <ul>
          <li>Start early — compounding works like magic when you give it time.</li>
          <li>Diversify — don’t put all your money into one stock, fund, or asset.</li>
          <li>Think long-term — avoid panic when markets rise or fall.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For beginners, <b>index funds</b> and <b>exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</b> are great. 
        They are simple, low-cost, and often outperform most actively managed funds.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 4: Mutual Funds -->
    <article class="card">
      <h3>4. Mutual Funds</h3>
      <p>
        A mutual fund collects money from many people and invests in stocks, bonds, or other assets. 
        This makes it easier for small investors to participate in the market with less risk.
      </p>
      <p>Types of mutual funds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Equity funds</b>: Higher risk, higher return (best for long-term).</li>
        <li><b>Debt funds</b>: Safer, but lower returns (good for short-term goals).</li>
        <li><b>Hybrid funds</b>: Mix of both equity and debt.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Beginners can start with a <b>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</b>, investing small amounts regularly. 
        This builds discipline and avoids the risk of timing the market.

    <!-- Section 5: Insurance -->
    <article class="card">
      <h3>5. Importance of Insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Insurance protects you from financial disasters. Without it, a medical emergency or accident could wipe out years of savings. 
        The most essential ones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Health insurance</b> — covers hospital expenses</li>
        <li><b>Term life insurance</b> — protects your family if something happens to you</li>
        <li><b>Vehicle insurance</b> — required by law and protects against accidents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, insurance is for <b>protection, not investment</b>. Avoid mixing insurance with investment products (like ULIPs).

    <!-- Section 6: Retirement Planning -->
    <article class="card">
      <h3>6. Retirement Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Retirement may look far away, but planning today makes the future secure. 
        Thanks to inflation, the value of money reduces over time. What costs ₹50,000 a month today might cost ₹1,50,000 in 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools for retirement in India:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provident Fund (EPF/PPF)</li>
        <li>National Pension Scheme (NPS)</li>
        <li>Equity mutual funds for long-term growth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Start small, but start early. Compounding will do the heavy lifting for you.
