      <h3>1. Understanding Money and Personal Finance</h3>
      <p>
        Money is a story we all agree to believe. A thousand-rupee note is just a piece of paper until
        the entire country accepts it as value. This story is powerful enough to make strangers trust
        each other, trade, and build empires. But here’s the catch: most of us live our lives 
        serving this story without ever trying to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal finance is the art of not becoming a slave to money’s story. It’s not about 
        getting rich quickly — that’s how you end up in scams. It’s about creating enough 
        <b>optionality</b> in life: freedom from monthly panic, from the boss you hate, from the 
        constant dread of “what if tomorrow something goes wrong.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask yourself: If tomorrow you stopped earning, how long could you survive before panic sets in? 
        The answer is not your salary; it’s your savings, your debts, and your habits. 
        Finance is the invisible architecture of your freedom.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “The goal isn’t to get rich. The goal is to stay rich long enough to live the life you want.” 
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If you can grasp this — that money is both an illusion and the most practical tool — 
        you’ve already moved ahead of 90% of people who treat it only as a way to buy things.

      <h3>2. Budgeting and Saving</h3>
      <p>
        Saving money is boring. Which is why most people avoid it. But survival is also boring — 
        and it’s the prerequisite for everything else. The man who saves looks foolish in the short 
        term (skipping that iPhone, renting instead of buying), but looks like a genius when crises 
        come knocking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of savings as <b>insurance against randomness</b>. Life will throw dice at you: job loss, 
        medical bills, weddings, pandemics. The saver can shrug. The spender panics.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple way to start is the <b>50/30/20 rule</b>:  
        50% for needs, 30% for wants, 20% for saving/investing. But don’t worship the numbers. 
        Worship the principle: always spend less than you earn, and protect the gap. 
        That gap is your freedom fund.
      </p>

           alt="Budgeting methods" width="100%">
      <p>
        In India, put your emergency savings (6–12 months of expenses) in a 
        <b>liquid mutual fund</b> or a simple bank savings account. Don’t chase returns here — 
        this money is not for growth, it’s for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: A man with ₹0 in savings is one unlucky break away from slavery. 
        A man with 12 months of savings is free to walk away from nonsense.

      <h3>3. Basics of Investing</h3>
      <p>
        Saving protects you. Investing grows you. If you stop at savings, inflation — that silent tax — 
        will eat your wealth slowly. A ₹100 note today will be worth ₹70 or less in a decade. 
        To beat this, you must invest.
      </p>
      <p>
        But investing isn’t gambling on hot stocks or tips from WhatsApp groups. 
        It’s owning a slice of human progress. Every time you invest in a company, 
        you’re betting that people will continue to buy things, innovate, and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In India, you’ll hear about the <b>Nifty 50</b> or <b>Sensex</b>. 
        These are just baskets of the country’s top companies. Over long periods, 
        they’ve grown because India has grown. Instead of trying to pick the next Infosys or Reliance, 
        you can simply buy the whole basket through an <b>index fund</b>.
      </p>
      <img src="https://www.finology.in/financial-learning/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Compounding.png" 
           alt="Power of Compounding" width="100%">
      <p>
        Compounding is the closest thing to magic in finance. If you invest ₹10,000 every month in a 
        Nifty 50 index fund, earning just 12% annually, in 20 years you’ll have ~₹1 crore. 
        Not because you worked harder, but because time and patience did the heavy lifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For beginners: start with <b>SIPs in index mutual funds</b>. 
        Avoid stock tips, intraday trading, or anything promising quick riches. 
        They are casinos disguised as finance. Wealth is built slowly, invisibly, boringly.
